            <h1 id="title">What We Did!</h1>
            <p id="Description">So it was me and my girlfriends two month and she planned everything out for this day. First time she had ever done that which was nice and relaxing for me. First thing we did was head to scottsdale fashion square and see the movie old which was just okay but still fun. Next we went to dinner down in scottsdale and got some italian food and took pictures under some lights. Then for desert we went to an sugar bowl ice cream parlor and split a sundae which was really good. Then we drove home and watched ted until she had to leave, but it still was one of the best nights.</p>

            <h1 id="great">Why It Was Great!</h1>
            <p id="meaning">This was the the best night of summer but not for any specific reason. It was just a great and simple night where all we did was get movie,dinner,and ice cream. The night was our last date before school started again and we made the most of it. This was by far the best night of summer since it was our last night of summer together.</p>
