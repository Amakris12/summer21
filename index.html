            <p id="Description">So it was me and my girlfriends two month and she planned everything out for this day. First time she had ever done that which was nice and relaxing for me. First thing we did was head to scottsdale fashion square and see the movie old which was just okay but still fun. Next we went to dinner down in scottsdale and got some italian food and took pictures under some lights. Then for desert we went to an sugar bowl ice cream parlor and split a sundae which was really good. Then we drove home and watched ted until she had to leave, but it still was one of the best nights.</p>
